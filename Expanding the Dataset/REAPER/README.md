 # Using the provided REAPER project files

The folder contains a `.RPP` project file and `.reapeaks` files for the input signals. In order for the project to work, input data needs to be [downloaded](https://github.com/Mhuzvar/GFXSetCTU#how-to-access) and added to the project folder.

Project is tested to work under [REAPER](https://www.reaper.fm/) v6.78 with [SWS extension](https://www.sws-extension.org/) v2.13.2.1 installed.
